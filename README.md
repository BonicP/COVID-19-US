# Exploratory Data Analysis of COVID-19 trends in the US

In this project I looked to analyze trends in COVID-19 cases and deaths in the US and the impact that the process of vaccination had on these trends.

Data collected about cases and deaths went from the 1st of January of 2020 to the 23rd of March 2023, while data collected about vaccinations went from the 12th of January 2021 to the 10th of May 2023. To make sense of the results I only drew conclusions from the period where these two datasets overlapped.
